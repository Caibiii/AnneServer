*** If you want to update your GeoIP databases while the game server is running. ****

Place any of your *UPDATED* files you want (here, 'data/GeoResolver/Update/' directory).

1. GeoLite2-City.mmdb
2. GeoLiteCity.dat
3. GeoIPCity.dat	// Paid version of GeoIP City (if any)
4. GeoIPISP.dat		// Paid version of GeoIP ISP (if any)

They will be moved from this folder when the map changes to 'data/GeoResolver/' directory,
in order to perform the update.
